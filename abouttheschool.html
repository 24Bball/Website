			<span style="font-size: 15pt;">The Yale School of Art is a graduate
				school that confers Master of Fine
				Arts Degrees in Graphic Design,
				Painting/Printmaking, Photography,
				and Sculpture.
				Artists and designers of unusual
				promise and strong motivation are
				provided an educational context in
				which they can explore their talents’
				potential amid an intense critical
				dialogue. This dialogue is generated
				by their peers, by distinguished
				visitors, and by a faculty comprised of
				professional artists of acknowledged
				accomplishment.
				The graduate student’s primary
				educational experience at Yale is
				centered on the student’s own studio
				activity. Supporting this enterprise are
				the experience, knowledge, and skills
				gained from rigorous, structured
				courses such as drawing, filmmaking,
				the relativity of color, and the rich
				academic offerings found throughout
				Yale. Each student is routinely
				exposed to many aesthetic positions
				through encounters with faculty
				members and visitors</span>
